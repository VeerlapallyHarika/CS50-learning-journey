My CS50 Learning Journey ‚Äì Few Selected Weeks and Practice Code

This repository contains my personal CS50 learning journey, focusing on selected weeks (Week 1 to Week 5) and practice code.  
The goal of this repository is to share concept implementations, explanations, and my approach to learning CS50 fundamentals.

üìÇ Repository Structure:

Week 1 ‚Äì C: Functions & Loops
- Introduction to C programming language
- Functions, variables, and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Practice: Basic programs, input/output handling, pattern printing

Week 2 ‚Äì Arrays
- Understanding arrays and strings in C
- Command-line arguments and string manipulation
- Practice: Implementing Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher

Week 3 ‚Äì Algorithms
- Time complexity and Big-O notation
- Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
- Sorting: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort

Week 4 ‚Äì Memory
- Memory concepts: Stack, Heap
- Pointers, addresses, and arrays
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Practice: String copying, pointer arithmetic

Week 5 ‚Äì Data Structures
- Introduction to abstract data types
- Linked Lists: insert, delete, traversal
- Stacks and Queues: Implementation using arrays and linked lists
